  *Be Like Water My Friend*

Nebri is all about the flow of information. It can be between software, people, and anything with an API.  When you need to connect the dots between various agents, Nebri steps in with a minimal UI and a powerful workflow based on rules. It's a paradigm changing approach. Some bullet points to kickstart your project:

-  :doc:`admin/kvps` are the cornerstone data entity. Everything reacts to KVPs.
-  Nebri reacts KVP changes with Python :doc:`rules/index`. 
-  Results can be interacted with in your views (Cards, API's and emails).
